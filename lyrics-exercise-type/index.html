				I know you say you really like it<br />
				You never been here before (No)<br />
				I think we could be on to something<br />
				It feels so good to hold<br />
				You tell me if it's too much (No)<br />
				Maybe we should take it slow<br />
				I think we could be on something

				Face in the pillow ass where the wind blows<br />
				Everytime we link up sex is all we think up<br />
				Body like a city I got keys and the zip code<br />
				We don't even speak much all we do is drink up<br />
				Shots of the 참이슬 Blue dream chief up<br />
				자기야 이리 와 빨리 와 가자 All this love I hope<br />
				It don't hurt ya All this work I hope<br />
				It's all worth it Perfect, in an imperfect way<br />
				Jerkin, tugging on my shirt like<br />
				Aye I know you wanna get a taste
