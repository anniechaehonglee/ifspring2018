					I know you say you really like it<br />
					You never been here before (No)<br />
					I think we could be on to something<br />
					It feels so good to hold<br />
					You tell me if it's too much (No)<br />
					Maybe we should take it slow<br />

					Face in the pillow ass where the wind blows<br />
					Everytime we link up sex is all we think up<br />
					Body like a city I got keys and the zip code<br />
					We don't even speak much all we do is drink up<br />
					Shots of the 참이슬 Blue dream chief up<br />
					자기야 이리 와 빨리 와 가자 All this love I hope<br />
					It don't hurt ya All this work I hope<br />
					It's all worth it Perfect, in an imperfect way<br />
					Jerkin, tugging on my shirt like<br />
					Aye I know you wanna get a taste
