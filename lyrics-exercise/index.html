				<h2>"Put My Hands On You"<br /></h2>
				(feat. Anderson Paak)<br />
				<br />
				[Dean:]<br />
				I should be patient<br />
				But can't hardly wait<br />
				Something I wanted<br />
				Since the first day<br />
				We should go on with<br />
				What we're thinking bout<br />
				How could I know<br />
				<br />
				[Dean (Anderson Paak):]<br />
				And she said if you like this<br />
				It's yours, it's yours<br />
				(And I don't even gotta think about it<br />
				I don't even gotta talk about it)<br />
				And she said do what you wish<br />
				It's yours it's yours<br />
				(And I don't even gotta think about it<br />
				I don't even gotta talk about it)<br />
				[x2]<br />
				<br />
				[Dean:]<br />
				Ooh Look here baby<br />
				Ay yi yi yi<br />
				I just wanna put my hands on you<br />
				I just wanna put my hands on you<br />
				On you<br />
				Ooh when we're faded<br />
				Ay yi yi yi<br />
				I just wanna put my hands on you<br />
				I just wanna put my hands on you<br />
				On you<br />
				<br />
				[Anderson Paak:]<br />
				I know you say you really like it<br />
				You never been here before (No)<br />
				I think we could be on to something<br />
				It feels so good to hold<br />
				Feels good to me<br />
				You tell me if it's too much (No)<br />
				Maybe we should take it slow<br />
				I think we could be onto<br />
				Something when you told me baby<br />
				<br />
				[Dean (Anderson Paak):]<br />
				And she said if you like this<br />
				It's yours, it's yours<br />
				(And I don't even gotta think about it<br />
				I don't even gotta talk about it)<br />
				And she said do what you wish<br />
				It's yours it's yours<br />
				(And I don't even gotta think about it<br />
				I don't even gotta talk about it)<br /><br />
				[x2]<br />
				<br />
				[Dean:]<br />
				Ooh Look here baby<br />
				Ay yi yi yi<br />
				I just wanna put my hands on you<br />
				I just wanna put my hands on you<br />
				On you<br />
				Ooh when we're faded<br />
				Ay yi yi yi<br />
				I just wanna put my hands on you<br />
				I just wanna put my hands on you<br />
				On you<br />
				<br />
				Hey<br />
				She don't even try<br />
				But I believe she knows<br />
				Tell me just how far can I go<br />
				She don't need to try<br />
				She don't have to act the part<br />
				I love your body<br />
				<br />
				[Anderson Paak:]<br />
				Face in the pillow<br />
				Ass where the wind blows<br />
				Everytime we link up<br />
				Sex is all we think up<br />
				Body like a city<br />
				I got keys and the zip code<br />
				We don't even speak much<br />
				All we do is drink up<br />
				Shots of the 참이슬<br />
				Blue dream chief up<br />
				자기야 이리 와 빨리 와 가자<br />
				All this love I hope<br />
				It don't hurt ya<br />
				All this work I hope<br />
				It's all worth it<br />
				Perfect, in an imperfect way<br />
				Jerkin, tugging on my shirt like<br />
				Aye I know you wanna get a taste<br />
				<br />
				[Dean:]<br />
				And she said if you like this<br />
				It's yours, it's yours<br />
				And I don't even gotta think about it<br />
				I don't even gotta talk about it<br />
				And she said do what you wish<br />
				It's yours it's yours<br />
				And I don't even gotta think about it<br />
				I don't even gotta talk about it<br />
				[x2]<br />
				<br />
				Ooh look here baby<br />
				Ay yi yi yi<br />
				I just wanna put my hands on you<br />
				I just wanna put my hands on you<br />
				On you<br />
				Ooh when we're faded<br />
				Ay yi yi yi<br />
				I just wanna put my hands on you<br />
				I just wanna put my hands on you<br />
				On you<br />
