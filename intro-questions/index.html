			I used to pursue a degree in communication design, and prepped myself to go to an art school four years of my highschool before switching my major to computer science. I was initially attracted to coding because it let me be creative (in a theoretical, abstract sense) without using pens or brushes, with a few lines of code. I was attracted to this course because it lets me be creative (visually, like traditional artistic way) <i>without using pens or brushes, with a few lines of code.</i>

		<li>
			Yes. I've built <a href="http://www.anniechaehonglee.com">my personal website</a> from scratch. It's a bit of an ad-hoc coding because I learned the language online over summer, and the syntax is all over the place.
		</li>
		<li>
			I'd like to learn the proper syntax and underlying structure of HTML, CSS, Javascript.
		</li>
		<li>
			One biggest merit that being creative on screen has is that it can have interactive elements in it. For drawings and paintings, audience just looks at it, then looks at it again, and finally looks at it. They can't really do anything about already created art pieces--at least for traditional paintings and drawings. For designs on screens, audience can interact with it, learn what different elements do, and even add onto it.

		<li>
			<a href="https://narrowdesign.com">Link</a> Super creative. Unconventional scrolling of the pages. Uses the golden ratio.
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="http://www.legworkstudio.com/">Link</a> Effective uses of sections and pages, and scrolling feature.
		</li>
		<li>
			<a href="http://reddit.com">Link</a> Effective uses of sections, groups, subfolders. Works well with different range of people.
