						We don't even speak much all we do is drink up<br />
						Shots of the 참이슬 Blue dream chief up<br />
						자기야 이리 와 빨리 와 가자 All this love I hope<br />
						It don't hurt ya All this work I hope<br />
						It's all worth it Perfect, in an imperfect way<br />
						Jerkin, tugging on my shirt like<br />
						Aye I know you wanna get a taste
